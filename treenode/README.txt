TreeNode Midokura Code Testing

Author: Carlos Saltos


* Problem statement

You have the following Java class:

public class TreeNode {
   TreeNode parent;
   TreeNode findFirstCommonAncestor(TreeNode other);
}

Implement the 'findFirstCommonAncestor' method that given another TreeNode
finds the first (deepest in the tree) common ancestor of 'this' TreeNode and
the one passed to the method. Assume that each TreeNode is a node in a
binary tree. You may add methods but not data members to the TreeNode class.

* Solution code and running

The source code of the solution is at src/treenode and for running, there are JUnit tests at src/treenode/test.

NOTE: IntelliJ or Eclipse can be used for running the tests and also Apache Ant with the file build.xml
